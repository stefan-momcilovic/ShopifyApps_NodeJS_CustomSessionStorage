Are you a Shopify developer? Great!

Here you can find several ways to store user sessions in your database if you are using Shopify CLI. For this example, I'm using Nodejs and several drivers to connect to my database, create and save customer session in my database.

Choose yours, and maybe from this example if you building a custom template for an application or you are using Shopify CLI for applications this example can help you out how can you set up and save customer sessions in your database!

Happy Coding!
